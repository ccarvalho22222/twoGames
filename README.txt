These two games were developed during a game design class using the Unity engine and C# scripts.

The first game, Space Cylinder was created as a team of three, and is a 3D arcade shooter with a twist
on gravity in which enemies and the player are on different planes of a cylinder at any given time, giving
tension and surprise to the game.

The second game, Droid Colony is a 3D action/adventure game that is similar to something like Metroid,
it employs several different environment types and hazards, enemies, and weapons.

Downloading either game and playing them is not necessary, they were simply the first time I was exposed to
version control systems, and I had spent dozens of hours of each project with my teammates. 

There is an extensive amount of code and making sure systems and objects work together, it is the most work I had put
in to a project until my Senior Design Project with NUWC.

While some visual or sound assets were created by me and my teammate(s), the bulk of 3D models and texture work
from both games were "free" open assets from the Unity Store. 

Code source is found in the Assets folder of either project.
